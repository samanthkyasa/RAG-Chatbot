# RAG-Chatbot
This Streamlit-based application, Document Genie, is a chatbot designed to provide instant insights from uploaded PDF documents. It leverages Google's Generative AI model (Gemini-PRO) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to process and analyze PDF content. Users can upload multiple PDF files, and the chatbot will give responses.
